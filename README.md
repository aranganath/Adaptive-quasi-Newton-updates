## Quasi-Adam: Boosting exponential moving average performance with a 2-rank quasi-Newton Hessian approximation

### Usage

To run the operation on a 2-dim rosenbrock function use the command
```
    python rosenbrock.py --save-dir <dir> --iters <num iters>
```

where ```<dir>``` is the directory the file is to be saved in,
```<num iters>``` is the number of iterations the optimizer needs to be run.
